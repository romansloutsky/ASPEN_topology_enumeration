This repository tracks the initial development of topology enumeration using branch-and-bound, an algorithm now known as ASPEN, as described
in the 2019 publication *`citation will go here`*. A complete publication-time snapshot of ASPEN is available at
https://github.com/NaegleLab/ASPEN. This repository is retained as a historical record only.
